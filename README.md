### Steps to run this app

Simplest way to test this app is to go to the deployed version : [https://basher-sigma.vercel.app/]

The other method is to setup all the integrations namely:

- mongodb atlas cluster
- uploadthing account
- clerk authentication and webhook

and then add all the following environment variables:

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
CLERK_SECRET_KEY

UPLOADTHING_SECRET
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID

MONGODB_URI

WEBHOOK_SECRET // for clerk

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/

# Note: Creation of event might take time initially due to free version of uploadthing service which results in slow execution. Also due to lack of time some functionalities introduced in the code are left incomplete.
